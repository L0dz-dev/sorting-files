# sorting-files
this python project allows your desktop to be always clean and your files to be in the right place.

You need to run the program once, close it and configure the text file.
Once you did so, your desktop files will automagically be sorted in the "sorted" folder.

If you let the program run, it will sort the files on the desktop every 30 seconds.
synatx for the text file:

[extension]:[foldername]-

Example:
txt:TextFiles- #Your txt files will be stored in Desktop/sorted/TEXTFILES/
txt-           #Your txt files will be stored in Desktop/sorted/TXT/
txt:-          #Your txt files will be stored in Desktop/sorted/TXT/
